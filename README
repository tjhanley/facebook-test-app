Programming Challenge: FB Likes
Comparison

Objective

Create a Rails or Sinatra app that allows users to find out which interests they have in
common with their friends.

Desired Functionality

The app should:

•
•
•
•

Prompt the user to log into Facebook
Prompt them to select one of their friends
Retrieve the "likes" for them and their friend
Show the intersection between the two, i.e. the "likes" that both have in
common

Submission Requirements

Submit the code via Github or as an archive file
Host the app on a server where we can access it (we recommend Heroku)
The app should include unit tests
Don't worry too much about the visual design. We're cognizant of your time and
want to focus on coding for the purpose of this test.
• Write two short paragraphs explaining:
1. the design choices you made
2. how the app could be further improved

Hints

• You can write this as a Facebook canvas app, or as a standalone app using the
Facebook Javascript SDK (formerly FB Connect). Both should work, but we
recommend the latter for ease of development and testing.
• There are some nice Ruby gems that parse Facebook cookies (which are set by
the Javascript SDK after logging in) and support Graph API calls. One example is
Koala (http://github.com/arsduo/koala), but pick whichever gems you prefer.
• The <fb:login-button> tag accepts a poorly documented "perms" attribute that
allows you to request specific Facebook permissions
(http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web#registration).
• You'll need to ask for both "user_likes" and "friends_likes" permissions, in order
to be able to retrieve the likes via the Graph API.
• You can't use the various FBML friend selectors (e.g.
http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fbml/friend-selector) for our
purpose, as these are only for invites and similar Facebook requests and can't be
used standalone.
• Instead, you'll need to retrieve a list of friends using the Graph API and build
your own form to allow the user to select a friend.
